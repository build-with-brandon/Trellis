# Trellis Kaizen

Conduct a continuous improvement retrospective following the Trellis philosophy.

## The Kaizen Questions

Small, incremental improvements compound into significant results. Let's reflect:

### 1. What Went Well?
- What patterns or approaches were effective?
- What saved time or prevented issues?
- What should be repeated?

### 2. What Would I Do Differently?
- Where did we lose time or create problems?
- What patterns led to rework?
- What assumptions proved wrong?

### 3. What Should Be Added to Standards?
- What new best practices emerged?
- What constraints should be formalized?
- What documentation should be created?

## Context Lifecycle Review

Also evaluate context management:
- Is the current working context still helping or becoming noise?
- What should be preserved for future sessions?
- What should be cleared now that the work is done?

## Output

Provide:
- Summary of lessons learned
- Specific action items for improvement
- Suggested updates to standards or documentation
- Context management recommendations

Remember: "The trellis grows with you."
