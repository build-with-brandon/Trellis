# Trellis Context Check

Evaluate the current working context using Trellis principles.

## Context Lifecycle Assessment

"Context that helps you today becomes noise tomorrow."

### 1. Current Context Inventory
- What changelogs, scratchpads, and story docs exist?
- What context is currently informing our work?
- How old is each piece of context?

### 2. Value Assessment
For each piece of context, determine:
- Is it still actively helping?
- Is it causing confusion or misdirection?
- Would a fresh start be more productive?

### 3. Continuity vs Reset Decision

**Keep Context When:**
- It provides valuable background the AI needs
- It maintains consistency across related work
- Losing it would require significant re-explanation

**Reset Context When:**
- Spending more time correcting than creating
- Constant errors have created a pattern the AI follows
- Going in circles on the same issues

### 4. Recommendations

Provide specific guidance:
- What to preserve and why
- What to clear and why
- Whether to continue or start fresh
- What lessons to carry forward if resetting

## Trellis Principles Applied

- "Continuity beats starting over - until it doesn't"
- "Keep standards global, context local"
- "Bring lessons learned, not the broken context"

Be direct about whether current context is helping or hurting.
