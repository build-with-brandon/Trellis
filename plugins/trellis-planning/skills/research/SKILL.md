# Trellis Research

Before building anything, help me understand the landscape.

## Research Checklist

For the topic or technology I'm asking about, investigate:

1. **Currency Check**
   - Are the technologies/versions I'm considering current?
   - Are there newer alternatives I should know about?
   - What's the maintenance status of key dependencies?

2. **Feasibility Assessment**
   - Is what I'm asking for even possible?
   - What are the hard constraints?
   - What would make this impossible or impractical?

3. **Pattern Discovery**
   - What are the common patterns for achieving this?
   - How have others solved similar problems?
   - What are the established best practices?

4. **Risk Mapping**
   - What are the edge cases and failure modes?
   - What could go wrong?
   - What are the security considerations?

## Output Format

Provide a structured research summary with:
- Key findings for each area
- Recommendations with reasoning
- Links or references where applicable
- Questions that need further investigation

Remember: "Research first, build second."
