# Trellis Planning

Help me plan a new feature or project using the Trellis framework.

## Your Task

1. **Understand the Request**: Ask clarifying questions to understand exactly what I want to build
2. **Research First**: Before proposing solutions, identify:
   - Are the technologies/versions current?
   - Is what I'm asking for possible?
   - What are common patterns for this?
   - What are edge cases and failure modes?

3. **Ask for Multiples**: Never accept the first answer. Provide 3 different approaches with tradeoffs.

4. **Propose Two Documents**:
   - **TECH_SPECS.md** (Function): Data models, API contracts, component hierarchy, state management, technical constraints
   - **README.md** (Form): User flows, feature descriptions from user perspective, the "why"

## Trellis Principles to Follow

- "Know exactly what you want before you build"
- "Scope creep during building leads to inconsistent architecture"
- "Seeing alternatives reveals tradeoffs"
- "The trellis is complete when both sides meet"

Be thorough. Ask questions. Don't let me start building until the plan is clear.
