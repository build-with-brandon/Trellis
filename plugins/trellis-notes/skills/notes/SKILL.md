# Notes

Read and enrich your notes from `.trellis/NOTES.md` with additional context.

## Your Task

Use the notes agent to:

1. **Read Notes**
   - Read the contents of `.trellis/NOTES.md`
   - Parse and understand what you've written

2. **Enrich with Context**
   - Identify what you're trying to accomplish
   - Find relevant files in the codebase
   - Add technical details you may have missed
   - Suggest clarifications or considerations

3. **Return Enhanced Notes**
   - Present your original notes
   - Add contextual information inline or as a separate section
   - Highlight any ambiguities or questions to consider
   - Suggest files to reference or patterns to follow

## Use Case

Write out your thoughts in `.trellis/NOTES.md` first, then run `/notes` to get an enriched version before making your request to the AI.
