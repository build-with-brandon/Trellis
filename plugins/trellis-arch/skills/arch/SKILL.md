# Architecture Documentation

Generate an `ARCHITECTURE.md` file with comprehensive documentation and Mermaid diagrams.

## Your Task

Use the architecture agent to:

1. **Analyze the Codebase**
   - Identify the overall project structure
   - Map out major components/modules
   - Trace data flow and dependencies
   - Identify external integrations

2. **Generate Documentation**
   - Create `ARCHITECTURE.md` at the project root
   - Include clear descriptions of each component
   - Document the relationships between parts

3. **Create Mermaid Diagrams**
   - System overview diagram
   - Component/module relationships
   - Data flow diagrams
   - Any relevant sequence diagrams

## Output

The generated `ARCHITECTURE.md` should include:
- High-level system overview
- Component breakdown with responsibilities
- Mermaid diagrams for visual representation
- Key design decisions (if apparent)
- Entry points and main flows
